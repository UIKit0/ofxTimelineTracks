    Enter Notes with mouse or MIDI device
    Output MIDI notes to any device (with pitch and velocity)
    Resize/move notes with mouse
    Save/Load notes from xml file (needs to be updated to save track settings like selected device and range)
    Inputting a new note or stretching an existing note so that it overlaps an existing note start will overwrite the existing one, or doing that to a note end (but not the start) will simply crop the existing note.
